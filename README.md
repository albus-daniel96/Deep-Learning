# Deep-Learning
Deep Learning is the elder brother of conventional ML that uses artificial neural networks or ANN is making predictions. ANN, Convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network are among the famous DL models and are widely used in image recognization, speech processing, etc. Here you can find most of the commonly used DL models and algorithms.
